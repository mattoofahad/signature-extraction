    """Finds and describes connected components in an image as SURF features.

    Grana's (BBDT) 8-way connectivity algorithm is used to find all the
    connected components in the image. Then, 128-bit extended SURF descriptors
    (as detailed in [1]) with a Hessian threshold of 400 are used to describe
    these components. These descriptors are the feature vectors.
